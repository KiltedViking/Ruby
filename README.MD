The repository is a result of my attempt to learn *Ruby*, *Ruby on Rails*, and
*anything related* to them.
I use this repository to synchronise my test code between my computers (macOS, Windows,
and Linux) and to document things for future reference, and hopefully for your benifit
as well! ;-)

Please read comments in each file and/or README.md file in folder for what file 
or projects try to show.

## Ongoing projects

* Create useful example projects explaining basic concepts.
