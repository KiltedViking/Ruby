# kiltedviking/Ruby

This repository contains a mixture of this and that as a result of my attempts to learn.

The repository is a result of my attempt to learn **Ruby**, **Ruby on Rails**,
and **anything related to Ruby/RoR**, but also **Git**, **markdown**, and **editors 
and their Git plug-ins** (Atom, Brackets, and VS Code).
I use this repository to synchronise my test code between my computers (macOS, Windows,
and Linux) and to document things for future reference, and hopefully for your benifit
as well! ;-)

Please read comments in each file and/or `README.md` file in folder for what file 
or projects try to show.

## Ongoing projects

* Create useful example projects explaining basic concepts.
