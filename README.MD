# Repository KiltedViking/Ruby

This repository contains a mixture of **Ruby this and that** as a result of my attempts to learn.

The repository is a result of my attempt to learn **Ruby**, **Ruby on Rails**,
and **anything related to Ruby/RoR**, but also Git, markdown, and editors 
and their Git plug-ins (Atom, Brackets, and VS Code). I mainly use a Mac computer
at home and Windows computer at work, but every now and then I might test things
on a Linux computer.

I use this repository to synchronise my test code between my computers (macOS, Windows,
and Linux) and to document things for future reference, and hopefully for your benifit
as well! ;-)

Please read comments in each file and/or `README.md` file in folder for what file 
or project tries to show.

## Projects

Below is an overview of "projects" in this repository (either folder or file).

* `bundle-init` - generate file Gemfile
* `rest-sinatra`- simple REST API using gems Sinatra and DataMapper
* `scripting`- making Ruby file (.rb) into runable script file
* `basic_concepts`- a summary of basic programming concepts (work in progress...)
* `mongodb-test`- connecting to MongoDB database on localhost
* `string-count-words`- my version of assignment or example in YouTube video

## Ongoing projects

* Create useful example projects explaining basic concepts.
* Find a good markdown viewer plug-in... (to stop committing/pushing so often)
