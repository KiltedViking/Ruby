# About project bundle-init

This "project" was created to find out if one could generate the file Gemfile, 
i.e. not have to remember the exact structure. As it turns out, one can use the 
gem Bundler for this. Type command below (please note that no letter R at end).

```
bundle init
```

Gemfile in this "project" shows the generated file.

## What is Bundler and how do I install
Bundler is a package manager (?) and can be used to install all gems listed in file
Gemfile *and* specific/similar versions of the gems.

To install Bundler, type command below. (Might need to add `sudo` before command...)

```
gem install bundler
```
