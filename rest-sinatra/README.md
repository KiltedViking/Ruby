# About project rest-sinatra

This is an example I "copied" while watching YouTube video "RESTful APIs in Sinatra" 
by Envato Tuts+ (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4lxXu7UOwg). The example shows
how a REST API can be implemented using gems Sinatra and DataMapper.

I've modified example to use a database file instead of in-memory - mainly because
I couldn't be bothered to add example data every time ;-) and I got some unexpected
errors that were not explained in video.

## Run example
Run the example by type command below. The `-Ilib` argument is to tell Ruby to
include folder "lib" when loading. (I need to learn more Ruby before I can explain.
;-))

...
ruby -Ilib application.rb
