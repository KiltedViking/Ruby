# About this example

This is an example I "copied" while watching YouTube video "RESTful APIs in Sinatra" 
by Envato Tuts+ (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4lxXu7UOwg).

I modified example to use a database file instead of in-memory - mainly because
I couldn't be bothered to add example data every time ;-) and I got some unexpected
errors.

##Run example
Run the example by type command below. The "-Ilib" is an instruction to Ruby to
include folder "lib" when loading. (I need to learn more Ruby before I can explain.
;-))

ruby -Ilib application.rb

##Thank you to ...
