# Project `scripting`

This is an example of using a Ruby file (.rb) as an executable script file. The
file was created and tested on macOS (or, Mac OS X, as it was known at creation
time ;-)).

Steps required:

1. Add "scripting line" on first line in file.
2. Set x attribute for file (making it executable on macOS, Linux, and UNIX).
